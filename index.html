    <p>I am a student in the Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp where I am currently studying web development.
        I intend to use the knowledge gained in this program to pursue a career in full stack web development.
        Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's degree at the University of Georgia in 2017.
        During that time I majored in Communication Studies with a minor in History. 
        My educational background shows that I have a well rounded skill set to offer potential employers.
        Along with my knowledge of coding, I posess impecable written and verbal communition skills which have a variety of potential applications.
